## Inspiration
After reading up on the latest in AI generated content research, we wanted to both improve on and make easily available the latest advancements in detection for AI generated content. Specifically, we were inspired by the advancements of two AI research papers: Binoculars (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12070) for detecting LLM generated content such as the everpresent ChatGPT and Aeroblade (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17879) for detecting latent diffusion image generation models such as Stable Diffusion. When reading these papers, we realized a few problems which we thought we could solve. First, Binoculars, in its original implementation, doesn't fully take advantage of ensembling techniques common in applied machine learning tasks where maximal final accuracy is of utmost importance
